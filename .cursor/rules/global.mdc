All commands in the terminal need `uv run`, e.g.

```sh
uv run python -m pytest
```

* Do not run streamlit, the user will do this for you when needed
* Write unit tests with pytest for all non-streamlit functionality (e.g. converting from one type to another, or manipulating JSON)
* Only keep streamlit logic in streamlit_app.py
* Run pre-commit to automatically fix linting before trying yourself

## Testing
Run tests with

```sh
uv run python -m pytest
```

Always run tests after editing them. Then run the linter(s), and run the tests after fixing linting.
